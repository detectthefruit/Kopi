# Kopi

Kopi is a tiny, simple programming language built for learning and experimenting. It is meant to be easy to read, easy to change, and easy to understand.

## What Kopi is for

- Learn how a language works by reading the source code.
- Experiment with new ideas like functions, loops, and simple control flow.
- Build short programs without getting lost in complex syntax.
- Share ideas and grow a small community around language design.

## Run Kopi

Use the interpreter with a `.kopi` file:

```bash
kopi run examples/basics.kopi
```

Or use Python directly:

```bash
python3 main.kopi examples/basics.kopi
```

### Automatic PATH setup

In the Kopi dev container (Codespaces), the `kopi` command is automatically available in your PATH. After rebuilding the container, you can use:

```bash
kopi run examples/basics.kopi
kopi update
```

### Making `kopi` available globally (outside dev container)

To use `kopi` from anywhere outside the dev container, add the Kopi directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/Kopi"
```

Then you can run:

```bash
kopi run path/to/file.kopi
kopi update
```

### Updating the VS Code extension

To update the Kopi language support extension in VS Code:

```bash
kopi update
```

This will automatically uninstall and reinstall the latest version of the extension.

## What separates Kopi from Java and Python

Kopi is designed to be both easy to write and expressive:

- Clean, lightweight syntax that avoids Java's boilerplate while still supporting familiar statement blocks.
- Built-in collection helpers like `range`, `zip`, `enumerate`, and `sorted` make common tasks concise.
- Native pattern matching with `match` / `case` gives you powerful branching without verbose code.
- Optional semicolons let you write readable code line-by-line, while the interpreter still understands compact expressions.

## What you can write in Kopi

### Values

- Strings are written with double quotes:
  - `"Hello, Kopi!"`
- Numbers are written normally:
  - `42`
  - `-5`
- Booleans are written as `true` or `false`.
- Lists are written with square brackets:
  - `[1, 2, 3]`
  - `["one", "two", "three"]`

### Variables

Use `let` to create a new name for a value:

```kopi
let count = 3
```

Change a value later using `=`:

```kopi
count = count + 1
```

### Print to the screen

Use `print(...)` to show values:

```kopi
print("Hello, world!")
print(count)
```

### Read from the user

Use `read(...)` to ask the user for input and store their answer:

```kopi
let name = read("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

### Functions

A function is a named block of code that can use values and return a result:

```kopi
def add(a, b) {
    return a + b
}

let total = add(5, 7)
print(total)
```

### Loops

Use `while` to repeat code until a condition becomes false:

```kopi
let count = 1
while (count <= 5) {
    print(count)
    count = count + 1
}
```

Use `for` to loop with a start, condition, and change:

```kopi
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    print(i)
}
```

Use `break` and `continue` to control loop flow:

```kopi
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    if (i == 2) {
        continue
    }
    if (i == 4) {
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

### Lists and indexing

Access list items using `[...]` and find size with `len(...)`:

```kopi
let items = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print(items[0])
print(len(items))
```

Modify a list with `append(...)`:

```kopi
let numbers = [1, 2]
append(numbers, 3)
print(numbers)
```

### Useful built-in functions

- `len(value)` — number of items in a list or length of a string
- `range(n)` — list of numbers from `0` to `n-1`
- `range(a, b)` — list of numbers from `a` to `b-1`
- `range(a, b, step)` — list by step
- `append(list, value)` — add a value to a list
- `pop(list)` — remove and return the last item
- `pop(list, index)` — remove and return a specific item
- `insert(list, index, value)` — insert a value into a list
- `remove(list, value)` — remove a value from a list
- `keys(dict)` — list all dictionary keys
- `values(dict)` — list all dictionary values
- `join(separator, list)` — join list items into a string
- `split(text, sep?)` — split a string into a list
- `replace(text, old, new)` — replace text in a string
- `upper(text)` — convert text to uppercase
- `lower(text)` — convert text to lowercase
- `type(value)` — show the type name
- `sum(list)` — add all numbers in a list
- `min(list)` — smallest value in a list
- `max(list)` — largest value in a list
- `sorted(list)` — return a sorted list
- `int(value)` — convert a string to a number
- `str(value)` — convert a value to text
- `any(list)` — true if any item is truthy
- `all(list)` — true if every item is truthy
- `abs(number)` — absolute value
- `copy(value)` — shallow copy of a list or dict
- `startswith(text, prefix)` — check string prefix
- `endswith(text, suffix)` — check string suffix
- `round(number)` or `round(number, digits)` — round a number

### Advanced features

Kopi also supports:

- `null` / `none` for missing values
- `//` single-line comments and `/* ... */` block comments
- compound assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` 
- membership checks with `in`
- dictionary literals and property access: `data["value"]` and `data.value`
- `for (item in list)` loops for easy iteration
- `else if` chains for clearer conditional logic

### Conditionals

Use `if` and `else` to run different code paths:

```kopi
let score = 10
if (score > 5) {
    print("Great job")
} else {
    print("Keep trying")
}
```

### Comments

Add comments with `#`:

```kopi
# This is a note for people reading the code
let message = "Hello"
```

## VS Code support

This repo includes local VS Code language support in `.vscode-ext/kopi-language-support`.

To package and install the extension locally:

```bash
./scripts/package-extension.sh
code --install-extension kopi-language-support-1.0.0.vsix --force
```

To uninstall the Kopi extension from VS Code:

```bash
code --uninstall-extension kopi-org.kopi-language-support
```

To reinstall it after uninstalling:

```bash
./scripts/package-extension.sh
code --install-extension kopi-language-support-1.0.0.vsix --force
```
Alternatively
You can also keep the extension recommendation in your workspace so collaborators see it automatically:

- `.vscode/settings.json` maps `.kopi` files to the Kopi language
- `.vscode/extensions.json` recommends the Kopi extension

## Example lesson: `examples/basics.kopi`

This interactive lesson teaches you the basics of Kopi by having you type in your own values! Run it and follow along:

```bash
python3 main.kopi examples/basics.kopi
```

The lesson covers:
- Variables and storing user input
- Loops that run multiple times
- Conditionals that make choices
- Functions that hold reusable code

Each section prompts you to enter information, then uses it in the code.

For a second example that shows lists, `for` loops, built-ins like `len()` and `range()`, and list indexing, run:

```bash
python3 main.kopi examples/advanced.kopi
```

## How Kopi works

- `main.kopi` reads your file and sends it to the lexer, parser, and runtime.
- `lexer.kopi` turns text into small parts called tokens.
- `parser.kopi` turns tokens into a tree of statements and expressions.
- `runtime.kopi` runs that tree and produces output.

## Want to help?

Kopi is best when people try new features and share what works.

- Add more lessons in `examples/`
- Try adding `for` loops or `else if`
- Improve error messages when the code is wrong
- Share your ideas for new Kopi syntax
